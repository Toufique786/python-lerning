**Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50**

This simple Python program calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.
It demonstrates basic concepts of iteration and arithmetic operations in Python.

**ðŸ§  Program Logic**

     1.Initialize a variable total_sum with 0.
    
     2.Use a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50.
     
     3.Add each number to total_sum.
     
     4.Finally, print the total sum.


  **Even or Odd Number Checker**

This Python program takes a number from the user and checks whether it is even or odd using the modulus (%) operator.
**ðŸ§  Program Logic**

    1.The program asks the user to enter a number.
    
    2.It checks if the number is divisible by 2 using the expression user_input % 2 == 0.
    
    3.If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.
    
    4.It then prints the appropriate message.
